# The-Maze-Explorer
This game was developed for my thesis for graduation in MSc. BioMechanical Design and MSc. Systems and Control at TU Delft. The goal of the game is to study, using EEG, what happens in the brain the seconds before a decision is made and to study brain connectivity during a spatial navigation task.
